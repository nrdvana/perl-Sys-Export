2025-07-30 - Version 0.002
  - ::Unix::WriteFS can now create Socket directory entries
  - New method 'src_find' is like File::Find specifically for iterating
    files of the export source tree.
  - New exported Sys::Export function 'find' calls 'exporter->src_find'
  - Simplify exporter->add shorthand array notation
    (e.g. ->add([ file => $name, $data ])
    and move the implementation to Sys::Export as exportable function
    'expand_stat_shorthand'
  - You can pass a hashref to ->add containing 'src_path' and lacking
    'name' as a way to ask for source-to-destination translation of the
    path rather than using the attributes as-is.
  - Detect failures in 'mknod' syscall
  - Implemented ::Linux->add_localtime which was previously "..."
  - Subclasses of the Unix exporter can call $self->add to queue files
    to be added after the current one rather than messing with private
    fields to accomplish that.
  - Better support for running on non-Linux platforms, mostly in the tests
  - Documentation improvements
  - More tests

2025-07-22 - Version 0.001
  - Initial version, with functioning t/81-qemu-initrd.t to prove that
    the basics work.  But, it's a bit light on testing considering the
    overall number of features and potential use cases.
