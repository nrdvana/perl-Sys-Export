2025-08-16 - Version 0.003
  - API Changes:
    - Much more flexible DWIM on ->add method, such as specifying name and
      src_path and still getting automatic stat attributes added.
      Whether or not it rewrites now depends solely on presence of src_path.
    - Add missing accessors for ::Unix
       - on_collision
       - src_userdb
       - dst_userdb
    - Sys::Export -dst parameter may now be an arrayref [CPIO => $filename]
      for easy access to specify cpio output.
  - Bug fixes:
    - Too numerous to list.  But especially Linux->add_passwd and
      ->add_localtime are working as intended now.

2025-08-07 - Version 0.002
  - API Changes:
    - New Sys::Export::Unix->src_find is like File::Find specifically for
      iterating files of the export source tree.
    - New Sys::Export::find exported function calls 'exporter->src_find'
    - Sys::Export exports functions 'find' and 'skip' by default now, if the
      global exporter is being used.
    - New Sys::Export::expand_stat_shorthand exported function converts
      arrayrefs like '[ file644 => $name, $data ]' to the equivalent hashref
      of stat parameters.
    - Sys::Export::Unix->add now uses expand_stat_shorthand for its array
      shorthand, which is a breaking change from previous.
    - Sys::Export::Unix->add now allows hashrefs containing 'src_path' and
      lacking 'name' as a way to ask for source-to-destination translation of
      the path rather than exporting the attributes as-is.
    - Sys::Export::Unix->skip can accept multiple arguments and they may be
      hashrefs, like for ->add.
    - When the unix exporter's $self->add is called in the middle of another
      call to add, the file is queued to be added after control returns to the
      top-level add call.  This lets subclasses queue dependencies without
      messing with private object attributes.
    - Sys::Export::CPIO has new attributes 'autoclose' and 'filename'
  - Bug Fixes:
    - Sys::Export::Unix::WriteFS can now create Socket directory entries
    - CPIO archives now get properly terminated and flushed during ->finish
    - Remove references to current dir "./" from paths to prevent misbehavior
    - Detect failures in 'mknod' syscall
    - Implemented ::Linux->add_localtime which was previously "..."
    - Better support for running on non-Linux platforms, mostly in the tests
  - Many documentation improvements
  - More tests

2025-07-22 - Version 0.001
  - Initial version, with functioning t/81-qemu-initrd.t to prove that
    the basics work.  But, it's a bit light on testing considering the
    overall number of features and potential use cases.
